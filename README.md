# Geli Fashion Backend

# Project Overview

**Geli Fashion Backend** is a scalable backend application for a women's fashion boutique. The goal of this project is to support both **business operations** (product management, orders, customers) and **client-facing experiences** (mobile & web apps).

This project is also part of my **professional software engineering portfolio**, built with clean architecture principles, best practices, and a strong focus on learning and growth.

---

# Objectives

* Build a **real-world backend system** from scratch
* Apply **software engineering principles** (clean code, layered architecture)
* Prepare the system to scale as the business grows
* Practice professional workflows using **Git, GitHub, Maven, Docker, and REST APIs**
* Document decisions clearly to demonstrate technical understanding

---

# Architecture (High-Level)

The backend follows a **layered architecture**:

* **Controller Layer** → Handles HTTP requests (REST APIs)
* **Service Layer** → Contains business logic
* **Repository Layer** → Manages data access
* **Domain/Model Layer** → Core business entities

This structure helps maintain:

* Separation of concerns
* Testability
* Scalability

---

# Tech Stack

* **Java 17**
* **Spring Boot**
* **Maven** (dependency management)
* **Git & GitHub** (version control)
* **Postman** (API testing)
* **Docker** (planned)
* **PostgreSQL** (planned)

---

# Getting Started
